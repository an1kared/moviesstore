# PythonAnywhere Deployment Guide - Movie Store with Petitions

## üöÄ Complete Deployment Guide for Movie Store + Petition System

### Prerequisites
- PythonAnywhere account (free tier works)
- Your project files ready for upload

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Files for Upload

### Files to Upload
Upload these folders/files to PythonAnywhere:
```
moviesstore/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accounts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cart/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ movies/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ petitions/          # ‚Üê NEW: Petition system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moviesstore/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ db.sqlite3 (if you have existing data)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Include the petitions folder!
Make sure to upload the entire `petitions/` folder with all its contents:
- `models.py` (with MoviePetition and PetitionVote models)
- `views.py` (with petition views)
- `forms.py` (with form validation)
- `urls.py` (with petition URLs)
- `templates/petitions/` (with the new templates)
- `migrations/` (with the new migration files)

---

## Step 2: Clone from Git Repository (Recommended)

### üéØ Your Repository is Ready!
Your code is now available at: **https://github.com/an1kared/moviesstore.git**

### Clone the Repository
Open a **Bash console** in PythonAnywhere and run:
```bash
cd /home/yourusername/
git clone https://github.com/an1kared/moviesstore.git
```

This will create a `moviesstore` folder with all your code including the petition system!

### Alternative: Using PythonAnywhere File Manager
If you prefer to upload manually:
1. Go to PythonAnywhere dashboard
2. Click "Files" tab
3. Navigate to `/home/yourusername/`
4. Upload your `moviesstore` folder
5. Extract if it's a zip file

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Open a **Bash console** in PythonAnywhere and run:
```bash
cd /home/yourusername/moviesstore
pip3.10 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- Django 5.0
- Pillow (for image handling)
- Any other dependencies in requirements.txt

---

## Step 4: Database Setup

Run these commands in the console:
```bash
cd /home/yourusername/moviesstore

# Create migrations for all apps (including petitions)
python3.10 manage.py makemigrations

# Apply all migrations
python3.10 manage.py migrate

# Collect static files
python3.10 manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### üÜï New: Petitions Migration
The petitions app will create these tables:
- `petitions_moviepetition` (stores petition data)
- `petitions_petitionvote` (prevents duplicate voting)

---

## Step 5: Create Superuser (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python3.10 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Follow the prompts to create an admin account.

---

## Step 6: Configure Web App

### 6.1 Create New Web App
1. Go to the "Web" tab in PythonAnywhere
2. Click "Add a new web app"
3. Choose "Manual Configuration" ‚Üí "Python 3.10"
4. Set the source code directory: `/home/yourusername/moviesstore`
5. Set the working directory: `/home/yourusername/moviesstore`

### 6.2 WSGI Configuration
Edit the WSGI file and replace the content with:
```python
import os
import sys

# Add your project directory to the Python path
path = '/home/yourusername/moviesstore'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

# Set the Django settings module
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'moviesstore.settings'

# Get the Django WSGI application
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
```

**Replace `yourusername` with your actual PythonAnywhere username!**

---

## Step 7: Configure Static and Media Files

### Static Files
In the "Static files" section, add:
- **URL:** `/static/`
- **Directory:** `/home/yourusername/moviesstore/staticfiles`

### Media Files
In the "Static files" section, add:
- **URL:** `/media/`
- **Directory:** `/home/yourusername/moviesstore/media`

---

## Step 8: Update Settings (if needed)

Check your `settings.py` file. The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` should include your domain:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourusername.pythonanywhere.com', '127.0.0.1', 'localhost']
```

---

## Step 9: Reload and Test

1. Click the green "Reload" button in the Web tab
2. Visit your site: `https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`
3. Test the petition feature:
   - Go to `/petitions/`
   - Create a new petition
   - Vote on petitions

---

## üÜï Testing the Petition Feature

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] Navigate to `/petitions/` - should show petition list
- [ ] Click "Start a New Petition" - should require login
- [ ] Create a petition with valid data
- [ ] Vote on the petition
- [ ] Verify vote count increases
- [ ] Try voting again - should show "already voted" message
- [ ] Check that petitions are sorted by vote count
